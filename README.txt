## Project Details 

This is a project built for the University of St Andrews, CS5003, Practical 2. 
The aim of the project is to build a multiplayer checkers game to play against the computer as another user. 
 
## What Technologies We Used

We used a variety of front and back end technologies to build a single-page web application. 

Back End:
1. Node + Express: Our backend was built on multiple api call requests from the client to interact with current status of the board, number is user's logging in and each move made by any user. 


Front End:
1. JavaScript: The front end has been built on JS majorly to interact with html elements. 

2. jQuery: DOM manipulation to make the code simpler and easier. Also a lot of jQuery functions have used to show interactivity on the webpage frontend.
